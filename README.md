## Dependencies

The Mubeen app relies on the following dependencies:

- `flutter`: the Flutter framework for building cross-platform apps.
- `http`: a package for making HTTP requests to retrieve data from the Al-Quran Cloud API.

## Getting Started

To run the Mubeen app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.
4. Run `flutter pub get` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
5. Connect a device or start an emulator.
6. Run `flutter run` to launch the app on the connected device or emulator.

Note: You may need to configure the necessary permissions and set up an internet connection to access the Al-Quran Cloud API.

## API Integration

The Mubeen app integrates with the Al-Quran Cloud API (https://alquran.cloud/api) to fetch Quranic data, including verses, translations, and audio recitations. The app utilizes the `http` package to make HTTP requests and retrieve the required data from the API.

To integrate the API with the Mubeen app, ensure that you have a valid API key from Al-Quran Cloud. Then, update the API endpoints and headers in the code to authenticate and access the desired Quranic data.
